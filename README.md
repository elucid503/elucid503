# Hello World!
I'm Elucid, a developer from New York, studing computer science in Connecticut. I manage a growing startup: Sprout, where I work on big projects. What I beleive sets me apart is that I genuinely enjoy perfecting my work.

# Why?
Over the past few years, I've learned multiple programming languages, but more importantly, some important concepts and ideas. Building things and meeting other people who do the same brings me great joy. I hope to contribute something meaningful with my work as well as work with others who also do.

# How?
I've spent my free time mainly working on music services, as I love music and find developing with it quite amazing. When I'm not coding on my free time, I'm probably working on my photography hobby or (trying) to learn and do new things.
