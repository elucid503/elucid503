# My Background
Over the past few years, I've learned multiple programming languages, but more importantly, concepts and ideas. I've also learned that building things and meeting other people who do the same brings me great joy.

# My Work
Lots of my free time so far has been spent working mainly on music services. When I'm not coding on my free time, I'm probably working on my photography hobby or (trying) to learn and do new things. 

## Reach Out!
