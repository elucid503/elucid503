# Hello World!
I'm Elucid, a developer from New York. I manage a non-profit startup Sprout, where I work on whatever I'm told is impossible. Aside from always trying to innovate, I love to perfect my work, and I never give up. Innovating requires failing.

# Why?
I've learned over 10 programming languages over 2 years. Building things and meeting other people who do brings me great joy. I hope to contribute something meaningful with my work as well as work with others who also do.

# How?
I've spent my free time mainly working on music services, as I love music and find developing with it quite amazing. When I'm not coding on my free time, I'm probably working on my photography hobby or learning new things.
